# pbi-knowledge
This repository houses knowledge relevant to Power BI that I use on a regular basis.

Hi, my name is Niko Nino and I am a senior data analyst at SpartanNash.
My role has allowed me a broad range of experiences while employing an ever-growing stack, however, my true love is Power BI.

In this repository I will accumulate knowledge that I've gathered from some of the best sources around the web that have helped me to deliver kick ass reports and dashboards.
